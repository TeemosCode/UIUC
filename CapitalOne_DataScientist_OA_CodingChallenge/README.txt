Capital One Data Science Coding Challenge

The code for this coding challenge is written in Python3.5 on Jupyter notebook under the Anaconda environment.

I used the python pandas library to do handle data, the scikit-learn library for creating prediction model and the matplotlib library for quick data visualizations.

To run the code, the computer must have python3, jupyter notebook and five python libraries: Numpy, Pandas, scikit-learn, urllib and matplotlib installed. Open the terminal (or command line) in the working directory where this .ipynb file is located. 
Type in “jupyter notebook” to start the Jupyter notebook IDE in a web browser. The code are in blocks with some markdown explaining the workflow, code and analysis findings in between.
To run the code blocks, simply press the “shift” and “Enter” keys together, the code would run then output the results if not assigned to a variable.

The program first loads in the libraries then downloads the data from its hosted server into memory for process, it then also saves the information to a csv file on its working directory. The code is programmed to answer the questions of the Coding Challenge in order.


Due some problems with my own problem, the predictive models I created could not finish running as it continues to train the model but unable to finish it. I had to constantly interrupt it as I need to work on other programming assignments. Thus, the predictive models ‘can’ work, however, because my computer can run it fast enough for me to see the results, I can not be certain if those models were correct nor could I improve the model based on its outputs.

I did have ideas of calculating the longitude and latitude to visualize and map out the places where passengers are picked up and dropped off. I also hoped to create other predictive models based around on the credit card payment information with other data.
However, as my computer does not have the ability to quickly run the models and after looking into credit card payments with a few other data, I found out they do not provide much insight, information. Thus, I did not invest time into doing that.

Also, had I have more spare time, I would like to do more analysis regarding the date and time of the trips to investigate its possible impact of the taxi and passenger interrelations.
