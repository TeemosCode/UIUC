This homework is divided into 2 parts as shown below: HW9_extraction_classID.sh and HW9_show_classID.sh.

For part 1 HW9_extraction_classID.sh, you could combine any of the listed item as long as your code runs properly and output the correct results as we specified(result.csv in (I) and correct output in (II)).

There are multiple solutions for this homework. The grading will be based on the successful running of your code and the correct output as we specified. We will grade your homework on Google Cloud.

(I).HW9_extraction_classID.sh (14pts)

1. use wget or curl to retrieve the html file from "http://www.imdb.com/chart/top" (or use the file imdbNov262017.html in moodle) and save it to file temp.html (1 pts)
2. extract movie rank, movie title, year, imdb rating from the temp.html to create a dataset (10pts)
3. output the extracted information in (2.) to a file result.csv (comma separated) (3pts)

Grading will be based on running './HW9_extraction_classID.sh' and comparing the result.csv file.

(II).HW9_show_classID.sh (8pts)

1. output the number of movies in result.csv that were released before a given year (the given year is an input argument) (4pts)

2. output the title and the ratings of the movies from result.csv before the given year in (1.) (4pts)

Grading will be based on running './HW9_show_classID.sh y', where y is a given year number and comparing the output (to console / stdout).
